# Practice_Linq

This project is a practical assignment for an object-oriented programming (OOP) course focused on querying and analyzing football match data using C# and LINQ.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to get hands-on experience with [LINQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/linq/) queries by analyzing football match data. The project reads football match data from a JSON file, applies LINQ queries to extract specific information, and displays the results in a meaningful format.

## Project Structure

- **Program.cs:** Contains the main program logic, including reading the JSON file, applying LINQ queries, and displaying the results.

- **FootballGame.cs:** Defines the `FootballGame` class representing the structure of football match data.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
